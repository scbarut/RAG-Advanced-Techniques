Director Bruce Beresford handles the action scenes very well but in this type of story the most important aspect is the cast and their acting , and the director gets the best out of his cast especially Edward Woodward ( Normally an actor I don\\'t like ) who gives a career best performance and Jack Thompson . My only criticism of the casting is that a couple of actors playing British characters let their Aussie accents slip a little , but I\\'m nitpicking .\\nJust to sum up this is a very intelligent story of a dirty war , dirty politics and dirty justice which will appeal to serious historians and former servicemen rather than professional pacifists\\n\\nBREAKER MORANT is the dramatisation of a real life incident during the Boer war , the first \" dirty war \" of the 20th century , where three Australian officers Harry Morant , John Handcock and George Witton are on trial for their lives for the murder of boer POWs and of a German missionary . What I love about this film is that unlike a lot of other movies with an anti-war / anti- military injustice agenda is that it shows the difficult situations soldiers will always find themselves in . The men on trial are victims , victims of politics and of a wider picture . With the killing of the missionary Germany wants to intervene in the conflict on the side of the boers , not to protect the noble South African farmers from British aggression but to get their hands on the region\\'s gold and diamond mines . In order to stop this happening the British government needs scapegoats in order to hang and Morant , Witton and Handcock were to be hung out to dry so it\\'s the politicians of the time who\\n\\nCorporal Sharp: Agitated, sir!\\nmore\\nMovie Connections:Featured in \"What a Year: 1980 (#2.1)\" (2007) more\\nFAQIs this a true story?\\nmore\\nmore\\nMessage BoardsDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for \\'Breaker\\' Morant (1980) more\\nRecommendations\\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends: Show more recommendations\\nWe don\\'t see very many films or dramas on the history channel here in Britain .

That’s useful to remember and something I didn’t realise until quite late in life. Shame and small jealousies are as much a part of the mix as getting excited by ideas that hadn’t occurred to them.

You can run an A/B test to measure the performance of many different parts of your sales funnel, including your email campaigns, landing pages, ad campaigns and more. And a few hours of work could lead to big boosts in conversions, revenue, and more.\\nYou can use split-testing to optimize your sales funnel.\\nSo what is split testing anyways? Basically, you will test two or more different versions of your campaign or asset. Let’s say you want to A/B test your landing page. You might set up one landing page with a call-to-action (CTA) that says “Click here to learn how to increase your ecommerce sales!” and another CTA that states “Click Here to Enjoy a Free Trial!” then measure which one performs better.\\n\\nSplit Testing takes commitment. You’re going to need to test a considerable amount of traffic to gather enough data to uncover meaningful insights. And a proper split testing campaign can take weeks, if not months to complete.\\nThis is especially true if you want to test a variety of elements. Still, the payoff will ultimately worth it. Using data, you should be able to increase your sales and conversions.\\n\\nIdeally, when you A/B test something, you change only one thing between the two versions. So when split testing the call to action, you won’t change around images, buttons, or anything else. Your goal is to determine exactly what is causing performance to increase (or decrease).\\nExample of a simple A/B test. Notice the different click buttons.\\nIf you change multiple elements at once, it’ll be hard (if not impossible) to determine which one is causing the change. By testing only one thing at a time, you can hone in on changes that are making a difference.\\nHowever, in order to determine whether something is having an impact or not, you need to gather a lot of data. We’re not talking about dozens of clicks, but instead thousands or even tens of thousands. If you test every individual word change and element individually, it can be difficult to collect enough data.']\n",

      "  - retrieval context: [\"“Live people were wrapped in barbed wire and thrown downhill”, – this is perhaps one of the “nicest” memories of the main character of The Boy from the Yellow House, a journalistic novel written by the Serbian writer Saša Milivojev. The author collected in one work just a tiny fragment of the atrocious crimes carried out by the Albanian terrorists in Kosovo before and after the NATO’s aggression against Yugoslavia.\\nThe main character, a 12-year-old Serbian boy who was kidnapped in broad daylight and who almost fell victim to an illegal organ transplant in the notorious “Yellow House” in Northern Albania, where no less than 300 people, primarily Serbs, were killed. Many reputable sources claim that the victim’s organs were sold abroad, from which profited the leaders of the terrorist Kosovo Liberation Army.\\nAs far as we know, the Voice of Russia is the first Russian media, which is publishing an extract from The Boy from the Yellow House in Russian.\\n\\nThroughout his career Tennyson remained interested in momentous changes in a character's consciousness, and his quest for a suitable narrative structure enabled him to discover a form particularly effective in dramatizing religious conversions and analogous moments of revelation. Tennyson's characteristic poetic structure takes the following form: the main character progresses through a series of discrete sections or panels that may take the form of landscapes, states of mind, arguments, or tests until he has a dream, vision, or other powerful revelation that effects a conversion to new ways of life and action. What is perhaps most distinctive about Tennyson's poetic structure is the sharp separation he achieves between sections in many of his poems. In fact, even when telling a story in an apparently straightforward chronological form, Tennyson always prefers to progress through a series of parables, songs, visions, arguments, and actions. His characteristic use of flashbacks,\\n\\nMiserable attitude of the main character\\nThis is a bit of a difficult one, because some characters have a miserable or negative attitude for a reason. There is usually some redeeming quality in their personality however, or a lesson they learn that generally improves the characters attitude. However when you have a character, take for instance a certain female character in a sparkly vampire book, who is this privileged person with the absolutely worst-negative-miserable attitude, it really makes for difficult reading. And it’s even worse when that attitude stays throughout the whole.freakin.series.\\nThe word “gotten”\\nI abso-freakin-lutely HATE this word. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! There are so many other WONDERFUL words that can be used instead of this horrible word.\\nEXAMPLE:\\nDamsels-in-distress\"]\n",
