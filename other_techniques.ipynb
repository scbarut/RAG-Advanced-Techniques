The really important commonality is that becoming a scientist or academic nowadays requires a considerable sacrifice in family time. I’m reading about the non-sense that Latham says goes on in politics, and it sounds a lot like the non-sense that seems to go on in academia. To “succeed” in academia you have to have a single-minded devotion to academic, never mind other things like having a family, or a decent standard of living.

First of all, every representative of states based on number of people is in the house. I am not sure what the number is... however, if these people go to Washington and vote according to their districts, instead of their parties, we would be so much further ahead. I am tired of people following the party instead of following the people. This would create bipartianism. As far as the Senate, we only get two per state (thank GOD).

As the country has turned more and more against government, the Democrats have essentially adopted the policy perspective of the Reagan administration and the Republicans have continued to move as far as possible away from the idea that government has a legitimate role to play in a civil society. The national political center has moved dramatically to the right. The problem for the both parties is that the world is not getting simpler: environmental sustainability, the global economy, the aspirations of impoverished people, the communications capacity of the Internet, terrorism and the growing technology of destruction both create and possibly help solve a set of vexing problems. Unfortunately, these problems cannot wait for the hidden hand of the free market to be solved. Government has a key role to play.

Everybody is the star of his or her own life in the most exaggerated way possible because everything is such a big deal and they are all rather self-centered. Tiny gets so wrapped up in his romances and his musical that he'll ignore capital Will's calls. And capital Will is so intent on shutting up and not caring that he is also not a great friend to Tiny. The worst is the toxic friendship between lowercase Will and Maura, but although she is terrible to him it's really out of a desperate need for his friendship. It's all wonderfully complex and entertaining.\n",

A better understanding of the subjective success criteria that business owners use is important because owners who fail to fulfill their personal goals are more likely to close their businesses, even when those are profitable (e.g., Bates 2005). Understanding personal values as drivers behind business owners' choice of success criteria is equally important because it has inherent importance on the health, well-being, and financial success of business owners. Living in accordance to ones' values predicts long-term personal well-being and satisfaction, whereas a misfit between a person's values and choices leads to internal conflicts and distress in the long term (Bardi and Schwartz 2003). In turn, distress has been found to impair business owners' financial performance (e.g., Gorgievski-Duijvesteijn et al. 2010; Gorgievski-Duijvesteijn, Giesen, and Bakker, 2000).\n",

You can run an A/B test to measure the performance of many different parts of your sales funnel, including your email campaigns, landing pages, ad campaigns and more. And a few hours of work could lead to big boosts in conversions, revenue, and more.\\nYou can use split-testing to optimize your sales funnel.\\nSo what is split testing anyways? Basically, you will test two or more different versions of your campaign or asset. Let’s say you want to A/B test your landing page. You might set up one landing page with a call-to-action (CTA) that says “Click here to learn how to increase your ecommerce sales!” and another CTA that states “Click Here to Enjoy a Free Trial!” then measure which one performs better.', 'Split Testing takes commitment. You’re going to need to test a considerable amount of traffic to gather enough data to uncover meaningful insights. And a proper split testing campaign can take weeks, if not months to complete.\\nThis is especially true if you want to test a variety of elements. Still, the payoff will ultimately worth it. Using data, you should be able to increase your sales and conversions.', 'Ideally, when you A/B test something, you change only one thing between the two versions. So when split testing the call to action, you won’t change around images, buttons, or anything else. Your goal is to determine exactly what is causing performance to increase (or decrease).\\nExample of a simple A/B test. Notice the different click buttons.\\nIf you change multiple elements at once, it’ll be hard (if not impossible) to determine which one is causing the change. By testing only one thing at a time, you can hone in on changes that are making a difference.\\nHowever, in order to determine whether something is having an impact or not, you need to gather a lot of data. We’re not talking about dozens of clicks, but instead thousands or even tens of thousands. If you test every individual word change and element individually, it can be difficult to collect enough data.']\n",

Director Bruce Beresford handles the action scenes very well but in this type of story the most important aspect is the cast and their acting , and the director gets the best out of his cast especially Edward Woodward ( Normally an actor I don't like ) who gives a career best performance and Jack Thompson . My only criticism of the casting is that a couple of actors playing British characters let their Aussie accents slip a little , but I'm nitpicking .\\nJust to sum up this is a very intelligent story of a dirty war , dirty politics and dirty justice which will appeal to serious historians and former servicemen rather than professional pacifists\", 'BREAKER MORANT is the dramatisation of a real life incident during the Boer war , the first \" dirty war \" of the 20th century , where three Australian officers Harry Morant , John Handcock and George Witton are on trial for their lives for the murder of boer POWs and of a German missionary . What I love about this film is that unlike a lot of other movies with an anti-war / anti- military injustice agenda is that it shows the difficult situations soldiers will always find themselves in . The men on trial are victims , victims of politics and of a wider picture . With the killing of the missionary Germany wants to intervene in the conflict on the side of the boers , not to protect the noble South African farmers from British aggression but to get their hands on the region\\'s gold and diamond mines .

The trial court ruling being appealed went in favor of the university, Hacker noted.\\n“This case is really about the principle,” she said, adding that students need “a bright-line rule.”\\nMichael Goodwin, an assistant attorney general representing the university, said the lawsuit still is seeking nominal damages from two university officials in connection with enforcement of the policy.\\nGoodwin assured the court that the university would not revert to its previous policy, but Hacker said that assurance didn’t have the force of law.\\n“Oh, come on,” replied one of the judges, retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.\\nA desire by the plaintiffs to be awarded attorneys fees also could be at play, Goodwin said in response to a question by Kozinski.', 'The judge said he’d rather not have to rule on the constitutionality of a policy that no longer is in use.\\nDuring a question-and-answer period following arguments on the ASU case and another, Kozinski said he regularly urges lawyers to try to have their clients settle cases.\\nThat can be better than taking the risk involved in having the court decide the outcome and achieve a result more in line with the parties’ goals, he said.\\n“I always consider it a victory when the parties wind up settling,” he said.\\nWhile sometimes litigation can’t be avoided, a different type of resolution “may preserve that resolution that lets them go forward on a positive note,” he said.\\nTags: abortion, Arizona, campus speech, protest zone']\n",
